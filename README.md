Super Simple CSS Grid
=============

An extremely watered-down grid for developers who want to write css without the bloat of a standard framework. 
Please note this will NOT work for every situation; that's what the frameworks are for.

## Notes:
* .bi requires a parent wrapper 
* .tri requires a parent wrapper with nothing except the .tri child elements inside
* The article and aside combination could be useful for 2 blocks of looping content or as alternating code blocks
